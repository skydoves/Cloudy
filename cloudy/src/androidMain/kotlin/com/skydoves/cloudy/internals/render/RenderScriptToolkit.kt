/**
 * A collection of high-performance graphic utility functions like blur and blend.
 *
 * This toolkit provides ten image manipulation functions: blend, blur, color matrix, convolve,
 * histogram, histogramDot, lut, lut3d, resize, and YUV to RGB. These functions execute
 * multithreaded on the CPU.
 *
 * Most of the functions have two variants: one that manipulates Bitmaps, the other ByteArrays.
 * For ByteArrays, you need to specify the width and height of the data to be processed, as
 * well as the number of bytes per pixel. For most use cases, this will be 4.
 *
 * The Toolkit creates a thread pool that's used for processing the functions. The threads live
 * for the duration of the application. They can be destroyed by calling the method shutdown().
 *
 * This library is thread safe. You can call methods from different poolThreads. The functions will
 * execute sequentially.
 *
 * A native C++ version of this Toolkit is available. Check the RenderScriptToolkit.h file in the
 * cpp directory.
 *
 * This toolkit can be used as a replacement for most RenderScript Intrinsic functions. Compared
 * to RenderScript, it's simpler to use and more than twice as fast on the CPU. However RenderScript
 * Intrinsics allow more flexibility for the type of allocation supported. In particular, this
 * toolkit does not support allocations of floats.

   * Blurs an image.

   *
   * The radius determines which pixels are used to compute each blurred pixels. This Toolkit
   * accepts values between 1 and 25. Larger values create a more blurred effect but also
   * take longer to compute. When the radius extends past the edge, the edge pixel will
   * be used as replacement for the pixel that's out off boundary.
   *
   * Each input pixel can either be represented by four bytes (RGBA format) or one byte
   * for the less common blurring of alpha channel only image.
   *
   * An optional range parameter can be set to restrict the operation to a rectangular subset
   * of each buffer. If provided, the range must be wholly contained with the dimensions
   * described by sizeX and sizeY. NOTE: The output buffer will still be full size, with the
   * section that's not blurred all set to 0. This is to stay compatible with RenderScript.

   * row-major layout.
   *
   * @param inputArray The buffer of the image to be blurred.
   * @param vectorSize Either 1 or 4, the number of bytes in each cell, i.e. A vs. RGBA.
   * @param sizeX The width of both buffers, as a number of 1 or 4 byte cells.
   * @param sizeY The height of both buffers, as a number of 1 or 4 byte cells.
